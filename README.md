# name_analysis
Mini Project for Data Science course @ Poznan University of Technology, Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence. The goal of the project was to consolidate the knowledge about downloading data, loading data and usage of Pandas library.

## Project requirements:
- only one .py script (what's weird in my opinion) 
- input files given by relative path directly from working directory

## Requirements:
- python 3.8
